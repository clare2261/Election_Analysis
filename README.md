# Election_Analysis

## Overview
Three counties in Colorado including; Denver, Jefferson, and Arapahoe, election results were given to us.  We were asked to use Python to find the total number of votes, percentage of voter turnout by county, the votes and percentage for each candidate, and the winner.  

## Results
The results are shown in the image below with the file path below the screen shot for reference.

## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used as long as a clean CSV file is under the same file name and in the "Resources" folder, replacing the previous CSV.  If we were to put the election results as a different name we would have to change line 9 to reflect the new CSV name.  Because we have numbered references to the candiate_name and county lists it would be imperative that these columns are the same in any new CSV or the code must be adjusted to reflect the new column index.

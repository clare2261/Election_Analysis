##Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used as long as a clean CSV file is under the same file name and in the "Resources" folder, replacing the previous CSV.  If we were to put the election results as a different name we would have to change line 9 to reflect the new CSV name.  Because we have numbered references to the candiate_name and county lists it would be imperative that these columns are the same in any new CSV or the code must be adjusted to reflect the new column index.
